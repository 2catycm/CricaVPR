This is the official repository for the CVPR 2024 paper "[CricaVPR: Cross-image Correlation-aware Representation Learning for Visual Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19231.pdf)".

The code will be released soon.

**Our another work (two-stage VPR based on DINOv2) SelaVPR achieved SOTA performance on several datasets. The code has been released [HERE](https://github.com/Lu-Feng/SelaVPR).**
